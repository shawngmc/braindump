* Drivers
  * Audio: SDL2 *Fixes weird running-too-fast behavior*
  * Input: SDL2 *Fixes weird XInput behavior*
* Input
  * Hotkeys
    * Menu Toggle: Add Controller Button *Typically button 5 on 360 controller; Controller combo is only for sharing in-game mapped controller inputs!*


# Troubleshooting
## RetroArch running way too fast
* Ensure FF isn't on (default bind Space)
* Ensure Audio is working - per [this](https://forums.libretro.com/t/retroarch-games-suddenly-running-too-fast-android-nvidia-shield/38092), emulation speed is tied to audio timing (I've seen this with very rapid inputs - changing driver fixed it!)
